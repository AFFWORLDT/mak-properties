                <li>
                  Lower Prices: Generally priced 10-20% lower

                </li>
                <li>
                  Appreciation Potential: Whilst construction
                  is in progress and the area develops, the property value
                  increases, resulting in significant capital gains upon
                  completion (40-50% appreciation for leading properties between
                  the time of purchase and handover are common).

                  flexibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minimal Down Payment: Most developers require
                  only a 10% - 20% down payment, minimizing initial investment
                  risk.

            Ready Property Investment
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-[15px]">
            Ready properties are completed buildings available for immediate
            move-in. Here are the key advantages of investing in ready
            properties in Dubai:
          </p>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-600">
            <div>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[15px]">
                <li>
                  Move in Now: The biggest advantage is
                  immediate occupancy. With a ready property, you can skip the
                  waiting period and move in as soon as the legalities are
                  complete. This is ideal if you&apos;re looking for a primary
                  residence or an investment property that can be rented out
                  immediately and start generating income.
                </li>
                <li>
                  See What You&apos;re Getting: You can
                  physically inspect the property before you buy. This allows
                  you to assess the quality of construction, the layout, the fit
                  and finish, and any potential issues you might not be able to
                  identify from just plans with off-plan properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower Risk: There&apos;s less risk involved
                  with ready properties. With off-plan purchases, there&apos;s
                  always a chance of delays in construction, changes in the
                  final product, or even the developer facing financial
                  difficulties. With a ready property, what you see is what you
                  get.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Established Community: Ready properties are
                  typically located in already developed communities. This means
                  you&apos;ll have access to existing amenities like parks,
                  schools, and shops. Off-plan properties, especially those in
                  new areas, may lack these conveniences for several years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Potentially Lower Overall Cost: While the
                  upfront cost for a ready property might be higher than an
                  off-plan one, you avoid potential future price increases
                  during the construction phase of off-plan projects.
                  Additionally, you won&apos;t have to deal with holding costs
                  like rent while you wait for the off-plan property to be
                  completed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-[15px]">
            In summary, ready properties are a good choice for those who
            prioritize immediate occupancy, a guaranteed product, lower risk,
            and access to established amenities. They may also be a good option
            for cost-conscious buyers who want to avoid holding costs.
